Prevent functions from being executed in sections of code that are
inhibited.  Commands in inhibited sections check for inhibit and don't
perform their actions if inhibited, but that is after the command line has
been expanded and functions resolved.  This won't be simple to fix.  Some
commands need to be at least partially executed during inhibits since they
may change the inhibit state.  Command line function expansion may need to
be moved into each command (yuk).
