Source code for the Embed Inc scripting system and the ESCR program.


Introduction

  The Embed scripting system is a set of routines that can be used by
  applications to execute scripts as an interpreter.  These routines are
  available to applications in the escr.lib linkable library.  The
  interface to these routines is defined in the escr.ins.pas Pascal
  include file, or the escr.h C include file, which is automatically
  derived from the Pascal version.

  This software includes the ESCR program.  It is a stand-alone program
  that uses the ESCR scripting system to execute a script file.  This
  makes it an interpreter that runs script code according to the default
  ESCR syntax.  The ESCR program source code (escr.pas) also serves as a
  example of how to use the ESCR script processing system.

Examples

  prime.es

    ESCR source file that computes prime numbers.  The start and end range
    to find prime numbers in can be set with the integer values "start"
    and "end".  See the header comment for details.

  fib.es

    ESCR source file that generates numbers in a Fibbonacci series.
