<p> Each explicit constant, symbolic constant, variable, and function
value has a data type.  These data types are referred to by name, and
are listed below together with their descriptions.  The data type
names are keywords, and are therefore case-insensitive.  The data
types are:

<p><dt><h3 id="bool">BOOL</h3></dt><dd>

  <p>A value of this type is always either <b>TRUE</b> or
  <b>FALSE</b>.  <b>TRUE</b> and <b>FALSE</b> are built in keywords,
  and are case-insensitive.

  <p>The default value for this data type is <b>FALSE</b>.

<p><dt><h3 id="integer">INTEGER</h3></dt><dd>

  <p>An integer value.  Its string representation is:

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;[<tt>-</tt>][<i>radix</i><tt>#</tt>]<i>number</i>

  <p>Where <i>radix</i> is the radix represented in decimal.  <i>Radix</i>
  must be from 2 to 36, with the default being 10 (ten).  <i>Number</i> is
  the integer number in the specified radix.  The letters A-Z or a-z are
  used for digit values from 10-35.  Each digit value must be less than
  the radix.

  <p>For example, each of the following has the value of 143 in decimal:<tt>


  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;143

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;10#143

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;16#8F

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;8#217

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2#10001111</tt>

  <p>Integer values are written in decimal by the ESCR system unless
  this is overridden by specific formatting.

  <p>The default value for this data type is 0.

<p><dt><h3 id="real">REAL</h3></dt><dd>

  <p>This data type is also sometimes called floating point in
  descriptive text.  The string representation is a consecutive string
  of decimal digits containing exactly one decimal point before,
  within, or after it.  This string may be optionally followed by "E"
  and an exponent value.  This is all interpreted as you would expect
  if you've used a computer since the late 1950s.

  <p>Floating point values are written with 7 significant digits by
  ESCR unless this is overridden by specific formatting.

  <p>The default value for this data type is 0.0.

<p><dt><h3 id="string">STRING</h3></dt><dd>

  <p>A string constant is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes
  ("..") or apostrophies ('..').  The value is the characters between but
  not including the quotes.  To include the enclosing quote character
  literally in a string, it must be written twice consecutively.  This
  only applies to the quoting character used for the specific string.
  For example, both these string have the same value:<tt>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't"

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dont''t'</tt>

  <p>The dictionary collating sequence is used for string comparisons
  of letters and decimal digits.  A string is less than another
  string if it would be listed earlier in a dictionary according to
  these rules. Upper case letters are immediately less than their
  lower case counterparts.  The digits 0-9 are less than all letters.
  If two strings of different length are compared that are equal up to
  the length of the shorter string, then the shorter string is less
  than the longer string.  The space character is less than all other
  printable characters.

  <p>The collating sequence is not defined for characters other than
  space, the digits 0-9, and the upper and lower case letters A-Z.
  The results for the remaining characters will be consistent on any
  one implementation, but are not guaranteed to be consistent accross
  implementations.

  <p>As a example, the following strings are listed in less than to
  greater than order:<tt>

  <p>"aB" "ab" "cd" "cde" "cde f" "cdef" "def22" "defaa"</tt>

  <p>The default value for this data type is the empty string.

<p><dt><h3 id="time">TIME</h3></dt><dd>

  <p>Values of this data type specify an absolute time.  The time is
  stored internally in 60.30 bit fixed point universal coordinated
  time seconds with zero at the start of year 2000.  This data type
  therefore has a resolution of about 931 picoseconds, and a range of
  about +-15 billion years.

  <p>The text representation of this data type is:

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt><i>YYYY</i>/<i>MM</i>/<i>DD</i>.<i>hh</i>:<i>mm</i>:<i>ss</i>.<i>ssssss</i></tt>

  <p>This is the text representation produced by the ESCR system when
  a time value is implicitly converted to text.  Hours are always
  written in 24 hour format, so there is no AM/PM indicator.  When
  converting to a TIME data type from the text representation,
  trailing fields may be omitted after the first slash.  Omitted
  fields will be assumed to have the value 0. For example, all the
  following text time representations indicate 2:00pm on Monday 23
  October 2006:<tt>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2006/10/23.14
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2006/10/23.14:00
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2006/10/23.14:00:00</tt>

  <p>When TIME values are compared, eariler times are considered less
  than later times.

  <p>The default value for this data type is the start of year 2000.
